# Project Overview:
The "Dynamic Price Optimization" project focuses on implementing a system that intelligently adjusts prices to maximize revenue and customer engagement. It includes the following components:

# PriceWise.py:
This Python script contains the core logic for dynamic price optimization.
It utilizes advanced algorithms to adjust prices based on market conditions, demand, and competitor pricing.

# consumer.csv:
This dataset file contains consumer-related information crucial for analyzing buying patterns and preferences.
It is used to tailor pricing strategies to different consumer segments.

# dataset.csv:
This dataset file includes additional data used for training and testing the price optimization algorithms.
It plays a key role in fine-tuning the pricing models for optimal performance.

# Usage:

PriceWise.py:
Run this script to execute the dynamic price optimization algorithm.
Adjust parameters within the script to customize pricing strategies.

consumer.csv:
Analyze this dataset to understand consumer behavior and preferences.
Use insights from this data to tailor pricing strategies for different consumer segments.

dataset.csv:
Utilize this dataset for training and testing the price optimization algorithms.
Ensure data integrity and relevance for accurate pricing decisions.

# Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Other relevant libraries (if any)

#Future Enhancements:
Incorporate machine learning models for predictive pricing.
Implement real-time pricing adjustments based on market trends.
Enhance consumer segmentation strategies for targeted pricing.
